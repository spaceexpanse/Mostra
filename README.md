# Mostra

NostrSharp is a Nostr client written entirely in C#, using Microsoft's .NET Core platform.
It is released under the MIT licence, and is free to use for any purpose.

## Philosophy

NostrSharp is opinionated. It prefers performance to features, transparency to magic,
and errs on the side of providing options to users in the faith that they know how to
tailor their experience to their tastes better than I do.

Initially, we are working on basic functionality, such as getting the feed working,
managing relays, and posting messages.
